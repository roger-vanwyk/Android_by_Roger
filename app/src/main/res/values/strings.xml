        "Android Basics Nanodegree.\n\n"

        "After successfully completing my study grant from Google LLC in partnership with the African"
        "App Launchpad (AAL) I decided to put my newly acquired skills to the test by building this app"
        "to demonstrate what I've learned, and how I put it onto practice.\n"
        "My idea is to show the user(s) my capabilities, creativity, and problem solving skills."
        "My reasoning is that this project might serve as motivation to afford me a chance at entering "
        "the tech environment, preferably, but not limited to Mobile(Android) development.\n"
        "As I am making this career change from a fifteen years military Air Traffic Management environment, I do believe that"
        "I come with fundamental soft skills and both leadership and mentoring skills to be beneficial "
        "to your team.\n\n"

        "Project 1: Business Card.\n\n"

        "This simple app focus on the user interface similar to the many "build your first app" tutorials"
        "available around the world wide web. It does not react to button clicks.\n\n"

        "Project 2: Scorekeeper.\n\n"

        "The app keeps track of the score between 2 cricket teams, by reacting to button clicks. "
        "Thus both user interface and user input are displayed.\n\n"

        "Project 3: Quiz.\n\n"

        "This app make use of Radio Buttons, EditText, and other view widgets to quiz the user(s) on"
        "a variety of Chess openings.\n\n"

        "Project 4: Musical Structure.\n\n"

        "As the name suggest, only the structure of an Android music player app is displayed, without the "
        "ability to actually play said music. It is build using Activities, Fragments, and do not require much.\n"
        "logic to the business end to actually make it work.\n\n"

        "Project 5: Tour Guide.\n\n"

        "A multiscreen app that serves as a digital quick reference to touring around South Africa. "
        "Here I made use of a ListView and Adapter to populate the screens with relavent information.\n\n"

        "Project 6: Networking.\n\n"

        "This app connects to the internet in order to retrieve data from APIs and parsing its response "
        "to populate a RecyclerView as opposed to a ListView.\n\n"

        "Please not that the data displayed are from the Guardian API copied and stored online, due\n"
        "to this project being a demo and me not wanting to make unnecessary network calls, as with \n"
        "the original project code.\n\n"

        "A final word.\n\n"

        "I am well experienced with Android Studio, and most of its functionality, including,but not \n\n"
        "limited to debugging, version control, and obviously the general process of developing.\n"
        "I code in Java and Kotlin, and is now familiarizing myself with Flutter.\n\n"
        "I am also comfortable using IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio Canary.\n\n"

        "Operating Systems I use include Windows, Linux, and Android x86 to name a few.\n "
        "Unfortunately I do not own a MAC yet, which is also the main reason I have'nt started \n"
        "developing for iOS yet.\n\n"

        "I am aware of my shortcomings with regard to the broader spectrum of computer science, by "
        "means of qualification,but do make use of various online platforms to gain the necessary \n"
        "knowledge which will definitely help me throughout this venture.\n\n "
